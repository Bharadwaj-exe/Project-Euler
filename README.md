# Project Euler — Python

A structured collection of my solutions to Project Euler problems,
written in Python with emphasis on mathematical insight, correctness,
and algorithmic efficiency.

Project Euler is a set of computational problems designed to encourage
mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking; most problems cannot
be solved efficiently without reframing the underlying mathematics.

Each solution here is approached as a reasoning problem first, and a
coding problem second.

## Design principles
- One problem per file
- Prefer mathematics over brute force
- Clarity over cleverness
- Optimization only when justified

---

## Structure
- `problems/` — Individual problem solutions (`pXXX.py`)
- `utils/` — Reusable mathematical helpers (added when needed)

---

## Language
- Python 3
